# Real-time auction demo
## What is this?
This is repository for demo of the auction system that proposed in my diploma thesis. I've implemented features that I thought was necessary to represent my idea.

## How to run it local?
- set your database for app
- `yarn install`
- set .env file in both workspaces
- `yarn workspaces server prisma migrate dev`
- `yarn dev`
